    "question": "Consider a reaction where compound \"A\" decomposes into compounds \"B\" and \"C\" according to the following equilibrium:\n2A(g)â†”B(g)+3C(g)\nAt a certain temperature, the equilibrium constant (K) for this reaction is 27.0. If the initial partial pressure of A is 2.0 atm, what is the partial pressure of B at equilibrium?",
